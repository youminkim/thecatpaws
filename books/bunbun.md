# Bunbun's Diary

## 21st May 2022
Dear diary, my name is BunBun and you will be my new diary! Now, I will introduce myself. I’m 9 human years old and have a brother but no parents. Sometimes, I wish they were still here, but it’s fine! You know what? People keep thinking I am a boy because of my name! Hey, it’s not that bad compared to ‘Robin’ or ‘Alex’! I play and live with my brother in a rubbish dump at the back of a dark alley. Yes, it smells but once you live there long enough, you get used to the smell. Wow, look how much time has passed while writing! I need to go now, me and my brother are going to find food to eat. 

Dinner was SO nice. We found some STEAK in the rubbish bin. Yes, STEAK. In a rubbish bin. I know right? Wait… that’s… a very strong smell… 
I think I know why they threw it away… I am going to vomit .... wait I think I have a bucket… somewhere in the middle… of my collection pile… Wait a sec diary…

Okay, I finished v o m i t i n g. It’s so disgusting I refuse to write the word properly. I’m going to rest while my brother finds some better food. Before I go to sleep, let me tell you something super cool. I can now read the time in human clocks! So whenever I need the time, I can just check the human clock I can see in the window above. So COOL!

Ummm… I just checked the time and a few hours have passed since my brother left to get food. And my brother is nowhere to be found!!! I’m sure he would not leave me right???  

## 22nd May 2022 

Dear diary, I think that today is THE WORST DAY!!!! My brother has officially left me! I mean he wouldn’t leave me, but I mean like he got kidnapped, or he got hurt, or… Ok never mind I’m sure you get what I mean…. I have been searching for him for like 5 hours! (SO LONG) *sniff*sniff*I hope I find him, no, I wish that I find him, no! I WILL FIND HIM!!!! Okay, I sound crazy, but I WILL STILL FIND HIM!!!!!!! 

## 25th May 2022

Dear diary, l have officially given up… I can’t find my brother, even though I looked for 3 days so…. I decided to move on and go somewhere else. I am prepared, I hope I can survive on my own. I have all my things and something to remember my brother (AKA you) ….. I will always keep him in my heart… Well, I’m going….. Bye-bye home I’ll never forget………  

## 26th May 2022 

Dear diary, I was trying to find a new home when this lady saw me. The lady was a kind-looking maybe 25? 26? Years old person with long brown hair (with nice gold highlights!). She looked pretty too! This woman knelt and asked, “Where is your owner cu—“, WAIT. Since WHEN could I understand human language?! Am I a magical creature? Anyway, I think the lady finally realised I had no owner or a brother… *sniff* because she carried me with her arms to take me somewhere. How come humans get to have long arms and we dogs have chubby, short ones? Smiling, she took me to a big red-brick building called “Fuzzy Paws”. Hey, wait a sec… I can now READ human language too?! What. Is. Happening. To. Me. Whoa… There are other dogs like me in here too! They even warmly welcome me, but I feel so hopeless… How can I be happy without my funny brother (who ALWAYS made jokes about pizza) who always protected me against cockroaches? I intend to never share my story or you, my diary, to anyone else. Sigh… I don’t think I can do anything now. At least the bed here is comfy…

## 21st May 2023 

Dear diary, 1 year has passed since that fateful day when my brother disappeared entirely from my life leaving only you, a birthday gift I received from him. I wanted to write here again like last time because things have changed. I have made friends with a cat called Purr. Purr is very… mysterious and can be a tiny bit snarky, but once you get to know her, she’s MUCH, MUCH cooler than you thought. She was the very first cat (and pet) rescued by the lady. She was very sweet and ‘like a fairy’ when she first arrived here, but from listening to the lady, who’s called Zoe, something bad happened to her. 1 year after Purr was rescued in 2021, someone finally adopted her. After staying with her owner for 6 months, tragedy struck! While waiting at the traffic light with her owner, an accident unfolded right in front of Purr’s own eyes that permanently changed her life. Poor Purr! Today it is known as ’The Sky Street Tragedy’, dubbed as one of the most tragic incidents involving pets, humans, vehicles and even a taco vendor. Here, I’ll put in a newspaper clipping for you (I got it from Zoe’s cabinet, I wonder why she put it there?)! 

## The Sky Street Tragedy 
  One of the most tragic accidents that have occurred as of 2021. Experts commonly argue about who, what, and how caused this accident, as it seemed like it was a plan orchestrated by a criminal mastermind or someone with ulterior motives. One of the strange things that occurred that led to ‘The Sky Street Tragedy’  was a partially successful attempt to kidnap 3 pets (they kidnapped 2, as reports indicate), and a car accident which included 14 cars and 8 motorcycles colliding (and crashing), there was a result over 63 people injured, but thankfully, no one dead. 
  
  The car collision was caused by the pet kidnapper running across the road in the heavy traffic. What made the traffic worse that day was Clover Town’s (where the tragedy occurred) celebration of a festival that is one of the local traditions (said to originate in 1989), called ‘ Love 4 Pets Day’ in which the town celebrates their love for their pets. Not to forget this accident ‘conveniently’ happened on Sky Street, which is the most crowded street/road not just in the town or the neighbourhood, but the city.
  
  Another thing that happened during all the chaos was that 1 pet (eyewitnesses claim that they saw a snow-white cat) escaped from the kidnappers’s clutches but collided almost immediately against a motorist, causing the motorist to spin and turn in a circle, knocking down 12 people then crashing into the middle of 2 cars. This then made the cars behind the 2 cars at the front (the 2 cars that the motorist crash into) all either collide or crash. In one case, there was even a motorcycle which flipped as it was thrown into the air 360 for a brief second (the motorist had fallen off the vehicle just seconds before the flip).  
  
  And this is not the end. On that street alone there were estimated at least 57 pets. Around 30 pets were directly involved in the car crash and had been heavily injured, at most 17 pets were shocked and ran away as soon as it happened. Then 10 pets died from the injuries that they sustained from the accident.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I feel so bad for her… I heard from the gossip gerbil (Greta) that Purr’s owner got injured and lost her (Purr) in the accident. Even worse, her bestie, a cat called ’Snowflake’ died (actually it’s pretty suspicious if you think about it though because her description matches the cat that got kidnapped…but I’m sure it’s nothing!)

## 1st October 2023

  Dear diary, I’m sorry that I was MIA*. I was SO busy renovating the secret base/HQ! I’m pretty sure I forgot to tell you about it because Purr, the self-appointed leader with ‘leadership qualities’ as she calls it, told me not to spill the beans about it to any pet. But… you’re not a living thing, right? Anyway, I’ll go directly to the points. 
  Ok, so I was invited to a SUPER DUPER cool spy agency! *squeeeeeeal* It’s just like the comic books Muffin** told me about! Cool gadgets, even cooler HQ, and not to forget, we look the coolest when we wear our agent-suit-thingy! I’m starting to have hope for my potential career as a spy. It’s my first week and I’m already almost at Purr’s level. 
  By the way, if you include me in the spy agency, it’s 3 members! Last time Mage’s sister, Lila, was in the spy agency too! I saw a glimpse of her exactly once when it was my first day. Weirdly, she disappeared while on a mission for the agency (it’s called The Good Gals :>). Lila… I’m pretty sure that’s just my imagination again! Well, BunBun signing off!

*Missing In Action
**Muffin is the name of BunBun’s brother 

## 22nd December 2023 (3 days till Xmas)

Dear diary, the time has passed and important stuff already happened! A new member joined and her name is Snow (hey… to think of it, doesn’t it sound like Purr’s last time bestie’s name, ‘Snowflake’) She’s a cat, just like Purr. Purr’s a bit mean to her. I think it’s because Snow reminds Purr of the infamous ‘Snowflake’, who is— sorry, was Purr’s bestie.

## 24th December 2023 (Xmas Eve)

Dear diary, I’m SO excited for tomorrow! Tomorrow, it’s Christmas! Let me tell you a secret, my birthday is at Christmas too! I know you’re probably thinking, “Does that mean you get other gifts, like, double the gifts?” But you might also be thinking, "Oh, poor BunBun! She probably only gets 1 set of gifts then." Well, yes (to double the gifts) actually. But I just discovered that some children with the same birthday can only celebrate either of the celebrations and not get double gifts. I’m grateful (and so excited) that I get double gifts. This year, I only have one wish. To have a happy life.:>
